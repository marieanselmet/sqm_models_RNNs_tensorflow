# Models of the SQM paradigm with RNNs in TensorFlow
For the [laboratory of Psychophysics, EPFL, Switzerland](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lpsy/)


This project aims at modelling visual grouping with the Sequential Metacontrast Paradigm (a vision paradigm).

- Different data sets tested.
- Different models of reconstructors (LSTM, PredNet, ...) and decoders tested (Dense, fully-convolutionnal, ...). 
- Different criteria, like minimum entropy, tested to model the "conscious percept" formation by the visual system and its discrete behavior.

The final project report is in ```sqm_models_Marie_Anselmet.pdf```
