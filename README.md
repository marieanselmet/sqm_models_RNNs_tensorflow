# Models of the SQM paradigm with RNNs in TensorFlow

This project aims at modelling visual grouping with the Sequential Metacontrast Paradigm (a vision paradigm).

- Different models of reconstructors (LSTM, PredNet, ...) and decoders tested. 
- Different criteria, like minimum entropy, tested to model the "conscious percept" formation by the visual system.

The final project report is in ```Lab```
